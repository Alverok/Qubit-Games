## Qubit Games 🎲

### 🪟 | Overview

Qubit Games is a collection of classic games implemented in Java to showcase the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This project includes:

*   Flappy Bird 🐥
*   Tic-Tac-Toe ✖️⭕
*   Snake Game 🐍

Each game is designed to demonstrate various OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

### ✨ | Features

*   **Flappy Bird:**
    *   Gravity mechanics for realistic bird movement.
    *   Collision detection for obstacles and pipes.
    *   Real-time score tracking.
*   **Tic-Tac-Toe:**
    *   Move validation to ensure fair gameplay.
    *   Board representation to track game state.
    *   Win detection algorithm.
*   **Snake Game:**
    *   Random food spawning.
    *   Score tracking based on snake length.
    *   Collision detection (with self and walls).

### 📙 | Implemented OOP Principles

This project demonstrates the following OOP principles:

*   **Abstraction:** Focusing on essential features and hiding complexities within game objects.
*   **Encapsulation:** Ensuring data privacy and integrity through well-defined classes and methods.
*   **Inheritance:** Leveraging shared functionality and code reuse across game entities.
*   **Polymorphism:** Allowing game objects to adapt their behavior based on the current context.
*   **Exception Handling:** Implementing robust error management for seamless user experiences.
